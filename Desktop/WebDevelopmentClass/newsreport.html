		<h1> Activist Investors Turn CEO Headhunters</h1>
		<h2>More Seek a Say in Picking New Management as They Aim to Guide Corporate Strategy </h2>

		<p> When the chief executive of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. was forced out in September, Carl Icahn had a proposal for the company: Let him help pick the next CEO.

Hertz agreed, giving the billionaire investor three board seats and letting two of Mr. Icahnâ€™s representatives join the five-person board committee seeking a new leader.

The role of activist as CEO headhunter is increasingly common for these investors, who typically buy stakes and look to push their own ideas about strategy or financial maneuvers. Recently, they have been vocal about the executive suite, seeking to advance their agenda by helping select company leaders.</p>
